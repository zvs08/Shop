# Water Vehicles Rental System 
Rental system proposes 3 types of vehicles to rent on hour basis: boat, canoe or paddleboard.

## Customers can 

* See available units on the shop of each type
* Rent boats on hourly basis $25 per hour.
* Rent canoes on hourly basis $15 per hour.
* Rent paddleboards on hourly basis $10 per hour.
* Family Rental, a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 20% of the item's price

## The rental shops can

* issue a bill when customer decides to return all rented vehicles.
* display available inventory
* take requests by verifying stock
  
Since classes are used various customers and bike rental shops can be instantiated as needed.

Customer requests rentals of any type and is free to chose any number of each item he/she wants. However requested vehicles should be less than available stock. Also for simplicity at the return customes return all types of rented items simultaneously.
